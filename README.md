## Overview
Welcome to **Flashcard Quiz JS**, an interactive and user-friendly flashcard application designed to help users learn and test their knowledge. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project showcases my skills in front-end web development, UI/UX design, and JavaScript functionality.

### Project Goals:
- Allow users to **create decks** and **add flashcards** for personalized learning.
- Provide two interactive modes: **Test Mode** and **Quiz Mode**, both designed to enhance learning by testing users' knowledge.
- Implement a **real-time timer** to track user performance and add a sense of urgency to the experience.
- Offer a clean, modern, and responsive design that's easy to use across devices.

## Key Features
This project contains several key features that demonstrate my ability to build dynamic and interactive web applications:

- **Create and Manage Decks**: Users can create and organize custom decks to keep their flashcards well-organized.
- **Flashcard Creation**: Users can create multiple flashcards per deck, each consisting of a question and its corresponding answer.
- **Test Mode**: A mode where users can answer questions from a deck, receive immediate feedback, and see their time taken to answer.
- **Quiz Mode**: A more challenging mode that presents random questions, provides hints, and allows users to track their progress.
- **Timer Functionality**: A built-in timer that tracks the time taken to answer each question in both Test Mode and Quiz Mode, helping users improve their speed and accuracy.

## Challenges Overcome
Throughout the development of **Flashcard Quiz JS**, I faced a few key challenges, each of which helped me strengthen my skills as a developer:

1. **Dynamic Content Management**: Ensuring that users can dynamically add decks and flashcards without refreshing the page required handling JavaScript events and manipulating the DOM. This involved:
 - Using JavaScript to store user-created decks and flashcards in memory.
 - Dynamically updating the UI without page reloads.

2. **Timer Integration**: Adding real-time timing functionality for both Test and Quiz modes required careful management of JavaScript's `setInterval()` function to ensure that the timer stopped once the user submitted an answer.

3. **Responsive Design**: I focused on creating a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design by using CSS flexbox and media queries, ensuring that the app works seamlessly on various screen sizes.

4. **User Feedback and Interactivity**: Implementing real-time feedback for answers---whether correct or incorrect---helped me refine my JavaScript skills in handling user inputs and displaying dynamic content.
